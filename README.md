# REST API of the Brazilian Federal Government Open Data Portal

dados.gov.br now manages the technological solution to improve the governance of federal investments in infrastructure, 
through monitoring and monitoring the execution of investments in Federal Government infrastructure projects. 
Optionally, other powers of the Union, States, Federal District and Municipalities may register investments in 
infrastructure with their own resources through a formal manifestation of their adhesion.

dados.gov.br, in addition to complying with various rulings from the Federal Court of Auditors, aims to meet society's 
demand for clear, updated and centralized information. Thus, it positively impacts the effectiveness of the execution 
of public policies and decision-making by managers, in addition to enabling social control through transparency.

The platform gathers information about the geolocation of investments and allows it to be integrated with other 
monitoring, control and inspection systems, thus optimizing citizens' access to information and strengthening 
transparency regarding the rational use of public resources.

## Environment variables.

Environment variables are one of the ways to configure the library for use, so none of the parameters are mandatory, 
assuming that if not informed, it is expected that the `ApiClient(...)` class.

Below is a table containing the accepted environment variables.
